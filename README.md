Minihero connects millennial armchair heroes who "like, wanna give back to the world and stuff". Minihero is "√úber, but for like, helping others and giving back to the world".

What greater good could you do then sit in your chair, and comfortably code the platform that enables people to physically go out and do the hard work in their community? Forget the fight of the Labour movement and struggles for people's rights of the past. You'll do all that ‚Äî and more ‚Äî without ever leaving the comfort of your chair or standup desk. Heros come in many different ergonomic arrangements. Are you ready to adjust yours for the good of humankind?

Self-deprecating sarcasm aside (momentarily), you'd make a bigger impact and earn more karma contributing to Minihero than those typical sleazy corporate-sponsored, happy-go-lucky, let's-get-the-nerds-to-build-it-for-free-under-the-banner-of-collaboration, hackathon exploitation fests. Minihero is free and intends to stay free, bullshit-free and open source, forever.

Power to the people ‚úäüèº
