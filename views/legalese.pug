    h2 Terms of Service Overview
    p Below is an overview of our Terms of Service for our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or service we offer. The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.
    p Your Relationship with Minihero
    p By using our Platform, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service. That is a legally binding agreement between you and Minihero.
    p If you break the rules, we may suspend or terminate your account.
    p Using our Platform involves meeting real people and doing real things in the real world, which can sometimes lead to unexpected situations. We can’t control what happens in the real world, and we are not responsible for it. You should use common sense and good judgment when interacting with others.
    p Your Content and Content of Others
    p You are responsible for your “Content”, which means any information, material, or other content posted to our Platform. Your Content must comply with our Terms of Service, which includes the Usage and Content Policies, Organizer and Leadership Standards, Member Restrictions, Payment Policies, and Trademark Usage Guidelines. Your Content is also subject to our Intellectual Property Dispute Policies.
    p We do not own the Content that you post. However, we do require that you provide us a license to use this Content in order for us to operate, improve, promote, and protect Minihero and our Platform for the benefit of you and others.
    p We are not responsible for Content that members post or the communications that members send using our Platform. We generally don’t review Content before it’s posted. If you see Content that violates our Terms of Service, you may report inappropriate Content to us.
    p Our Platform
    p We try hard to make sure that our Platform is always available and working, but we cannot guarantee it will be. Occasionally things may not go exactly as planned. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.
    p We are continually improving our Platform. This means that we may modify or discontinue portions of our Platform.
    p By using our Platform, you agree to the limitations of liability and release in our Terms of Service. Except as specified in our Terms of Service, you also agree to resolve any disputes you may have with us through arbitration, and you are waiving your right to seek relief from a judge or jury in a court of law, except as otherwise provided for in the Terms of Service. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.

    p 1.1 The Agreement. Minihero enables you and other members to arrange off-line, real-world Minihero events. The terms “Minihero,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Minihero, Inc. and our affiliates.

We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service. We use the terms “Terms of Service” and “Agreement” interchangeably to mean this document together with our Usage and Content Policies, Organizer and Leadership Standards, Member Restrictions, Payment Policies, and Trademark Usage Guidelines. Your use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement. If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement. If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.
    p Tip: We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and are intended to have no legal effect.
    p Tip: These Terms of Service are an agreement between you and Minihero and not between you and any other member. For more information, see our FAQ page explaining the parties to our Terms of Service.
    p 1.2 Revisions to this Agreement. We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.

    p 2.3 Account Information and Security. When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password.

      strong 4. Your Content and Privacy
    p.legalese__summary Summary: You are responsible for the Content you post on our Platform.

    p 4.1 Your Content. You are solely responsible for your Content. We use the word “Content” to mean any information, material, or other content posted to our Platform or otherwise provide to us (such as feedback, comments, or suggestions shared with us). You agree that you and your Content shall not violate the rights of any third party (such as copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights), this Agreement (including our Usage and Content Policies, Organizer and Leadership Standards, Member Restrictions, and Intellectual Property Policies) or our Trademark Usage Guidelines.
    p Tip: Search engines can see public areas of the Platform. Your Content within these areas, such as the name and location that you provide during registration, may appear in search results.

    p Tip: This license doesn’t give us ownership of any of your Content. It simply gives us and members the right to use it on or related to the Platform. This license continues even if you close your account, because it’s necessary for us to operate the Platform.

    p
      strong 9. Dispute Resolution
    p.legalese__summary Summary: If you have a dispute with Minihero, you agree to try to work it out directly with us first. If we can’t work it out, with limited exceptions, you must submit any dispute with us to a neutral arbitrator instead of taking the claim to a court of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action. Minihero has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other members, although we may try to facilitate a resolution.
    p 9.1 Informal Resolution. Before making any claim, you and Minihero agree to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. We use the term “claim” in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation in Minihero events. You or Minihero may initiate this process by sending written notice according to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution. In the event that we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days of receipt of the initial notice, you or Minihero may bring a claim in accordance with Section 9.2.
    p 9.2 Arbitration Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 9.5, you agree to submit any claim to JAMS, Inc., or its successor, (“JAMS”) for final and binding arbitration. In arbitration certain rights that you or we would have in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal. You and Minihero are each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law. This agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises during or after any termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Minihero.
    p 9.3 Arbitration Time for Filing. Any claim subject to arbitration must be filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
    p 9.4 Arbitration Procedures. Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires (“JAMS Rules”) in effect as of the demand for arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes. The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    p 9.5 Exceptions. You or Minihero may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any U.S. county where you live or work. You or Minihero may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Minihero pending the completion of arbitration. Minihero may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Minihero’s right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.
    p 9.6 Arbitration Opt Out. You may decline to resolve disputes through arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@minihero.org within 30 days of the date you first agree to this Agreement. Your email must include your full name, residential address, the email address registered to your Minihero account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out according to this process, then Sections 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 of this Agreement do not apply to you. This opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.5 (Exceptions), 9.7 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).
    p 9.7 Class Action Waiver. You agree to resolve disputes with Minihero on an individual basis. You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated or representative action. You are expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations.
